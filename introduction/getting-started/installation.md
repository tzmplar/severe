# Installation

## Redistributes

* [Direct X End-User Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
* [Visual C++ Redistributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

## Register

* After acquisition, and once after you get your license key (which should be in your direct-messages with the bot SBV2-WHITELIST-BOT (1134900862632865953)), you download the file which is located in the [#download](https://canary.discord.com/channels/876072383033798667/1194692050617127015) channel within buyers category. After the download is complete, you have to ensure your anti-virus is **off** by using either [Defender Control](https://github.com/pgkt04/defender-control), or [Winaero Tweaker](https://winaerotweaker.com/), after that it is as simple as running **software.exe**, clicking "Register", and putting in your credentials. Importantly, please note down your username and password either somewhere physically, or virtually (i.e: password managers). This will save you time and potentially money.

## Login

* We assume that you already have the binary file and your anti-virus is already off, the process is simply to press "Login", put in your credentials and proceed. That's it. In-case you're getting "HWID mismatch" error, you can go to our [KeyAuth](https://keyauth.cc/panel/SHELUV_PERKS/v-severe), login and reset it there, note that there's a 1 week cool-down in-between each reset so as to prevent account-sharing.
