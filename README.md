Welcome to **Severe's user guide**, within the articles, we cover user installation, usage, and reference to our implementation of the **Luau**.
# Product Description
**Severe** is an external, being one of the first on the market **post-Hyperion**, it is a very powerful and undetected tool on **Roblox**. It has a staggering, modern visuals, a decent aimbot, and other useful tools, as well as most importantly, a **Luau** environment, allowing those familiar with the language to further tailor their experience.
# Tooling
Before proceeding further, if you're here for **Luau** development, please ensure proper tooling. We recommend:
- **Zed:** as a code editor, it is open-source and is blazingly fast, offering alot of extensions and settings to tailor the UI, **Visual Studio Code** can also be used.
- **Figma:** for any graphical work, for example making a UI, we recommend using this, as it is a straight-forward tool allowing you to sketch and convert UI for **Severe**.
