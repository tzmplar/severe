# Interpreter

## Overview

This is the "Script" tab within Severe, this is the place where you run your code. It contains simple syntax-highlighting, however it does not possess features such as error linting, type-checking, auto-completion, and many more features that a specialized code-editor/language server may traditionally have.

## Layout

The layout is simplistic, composing of a text-box, and 2 buttons on the bottom to execute, and restart the runtime.
