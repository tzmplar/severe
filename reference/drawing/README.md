# Drawing

## Overview

Drawing itself, within **Severe** refers to a library which has functions for static ([retained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode)) rendering of objects. We offer 3 different ways of rendering:

* **Dynamic:** Offering best performance, and fast usage.
* **Immediate:** Ideal for a small amount of objects, or if the objects move.
* **Static:** [Retained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode) drawing, being best if you can manage it properly, or for user interfaces.
