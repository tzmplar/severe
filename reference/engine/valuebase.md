# ValueBase

Documentation for these functions and properties can be found [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ValueBase).

`ObjectValue`, `Color3Value`, `NumberValue`, `IntValue`, `FloatValue`, `BoolValue`, and `StringValue` inherit from this class, for simplicity sake they don't have their own sub-page.
